# My-Personal-Profile-Page
 Personal profile project
 
 Hi, this is a pretty basic website of 2 pages. The one think I am proud of is there are 0 errors with the HTML and CSS.
 This project took me a longer time not using dreamweaver but honesty I am glad I used Visual Studio. 
 I am also happy I used Git for the first time.
